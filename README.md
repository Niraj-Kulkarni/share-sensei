This project investigates the usage of Python and fbprophet for stock price prediction. It outlines the
approach used to create the prediction model after reviewing relevant literature on stock price
prediction. The fbprophet model was trained using historical stock prices and technical indicators as
inputs, and its accuracy was evaluated using new data. It provides a thorough overview of the numerous
machine learning methods, such as additive regression models and time series analysis, that are used to
forecast stock prices.
